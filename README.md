# Customer-segmentation-using-kmeans
Customer segmentation using K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar customers together based on their attributes or behaviors. K-means clustering is an iterative algorithm that aims to partition a dataset into a predefined number of clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform customer segmentation using K-means:

1. Data Preparation: Gather and preprocess the customer data you want to use for segmentation. This data could include attributes such as age, gender, income, purchase history, browsing behavior, etc. Ensure the data is in a suitable format for analysis.
2. Feature Selection: Select the relevant features or attributes that you want to consider for segmentation. It's important to choose features that are meaningful and can effectively differentiate customers.
3. Feature Scaling: Normalize or scale the selected features to ensure they are on a similar scale. This step is important as K-means is distance-based and sensitive to the scale of the features. Common scaling methods include min-max scaling or standardization.
4. Determine the Number of Clusters (K): Decide on the number of clusters you want to create. This can be based on prior knowledge or using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis, which help identify an optimal number of clusters based on the data.
5. Apply K-means Clustering: Use the K-means algorithm to cluster the customer data. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid based on the distance measure (usually Euclidean distance) and recalculates the centroids until convergence.
6. Evaluate the Clusters: Assess the quality of the generated clusters. There are various evaluation metrics you can use, such as within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) or silhouette coefficient, to measure the compactness and separation of the clusters.
